# Applied Machine Learning (Cornell CS5785, Fall 2025)

This repo contains executable course notes and slides for the Applied ML course at Cornell and Cornell Tech (Fall 2025 edition).

Note that these notes are slightly different from the ones used in my Youtube [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE9WGbi4QY&list=PL2UML_KCiC0UlY7iCQDSiGDMovaupqc83) videos from the Fall 2020 edition of the course. You may find these in my other Github repo.

All PDF slides (from Fall 2024) are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-M6tNLGOMa4erAMj31jwmm-6m2MK0Prw?usp=sharing).
